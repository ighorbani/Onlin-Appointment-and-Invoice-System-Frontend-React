## Breakdown Project
Since the databases were not available to me, I created the back-end and front-end of the project together.

- The backend was built with `NodeJs`.
- The front end was built with `React`.
- `Mongo DB` was used for the database.
- And also I made an attractive `Html, Css` UI for the project.

## PDF generation
I could use methods like react-pdf to generate PDF.
But the problem was that I had to use certain tags and it could not be styled as I wanted. So after making the UI, I used it to make the PDF to make it look great.
